Título: Master Class on Plan and Goal Recognition 
Resumo:
Plan and goal recognition is the task of inferring the plan and goal of an agent through the observation of its actions and its
environment and has a number of applications on computer-human interaction, assistive technologies and surveillance. Although such
techniques using planning domain theories have developed a number of very accurate and effective techniques, they often rely on
assumptions of full observability and noise-free observations. These assumptions are not necessarily true in the real world, regardless 
of the technique used to translate sensor data into symbolic logic-based observations. In this seminar, we explain plan recognition
approaches that rely on a range of assumptions about the available domain knowledge, from complete plan-libraries up to incomplete
planning domain theories.
