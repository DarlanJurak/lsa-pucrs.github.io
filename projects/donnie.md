## Project description

Most robot programming environment to teach programming for kids and young people are highly visual, 
with drag and drop features. Thus, these interfaces can not be used by blind people or people with a 
severe visual impairment. The goal of this project it to propose a new assitive robot programming 
environment that can be used by blind people. In addition to the visual feedback normally provided by 
ordinary robot programming environment, the proposed system also provides sound and vibration feedback 
to the user.

The same system can also be used by blind users to learn and practice about orientation and mobility 
skills in a given floorplan in reduced scale. The user can practice how to move in a certain environment 
in reduced scale by using a simulated or a real robot. This way, when the user goes to the actual environment 
with the same floorplan, he/she will be able to remember the floorplan and move with more autonomy.
