title: Environmental Monitoring Boats
---

## Project description

The main sources of water are being polluted by industry and population growth in unplanned areas, near the river beds.
The goal of this project is to design intelligent software system to control multiple small autonomous boats to measure pollution paramerter and take water samples.
Thus, we hope it could be used to help environmental law reinforcament, protecting our water sources.
