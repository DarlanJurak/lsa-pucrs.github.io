title: Environmental Monitoring Boats
---

## Project description

The main sources of water are being polluted by industry and population growth in unplanned areas, near the river beds.
The goal of this project is to design intelligent software system to control multiple small autonomous boats to measure pollution paramerter and take water samples.
Thus, we hope it could be used to help environmental law reinforcament, protecting our water sources.

### Goals

 - Goal 1: an integrated simulation environment to test and evaluate different strategies under diferent disaster scenarios.
 - Goal 2: test the integrated environment in real life application with heterogeneous agents.

### Milestones

 - Milestone 1: Integrate Digital Elevation Map of Porto Alegre into the simulator; status (%)
 - Milestone 2: Model different types of agents (UAVs, USVs, response team) into the simulator; status (%)
 - Milestone 3: Integrate multi-agent framework into the simulation model; status (%)
 - Milestone 4: Integrate alert framework into the simulation model; status (%)
 - Milestone 5: Test flow alert --> planning --> agent action into the simulation model; status (%)
 - Milestone 6: Model different disaster scenarios; status (%)
 - Milestone 7: Field tests with different agents in using real robots under realistic scenarios; status (%)
