### Goals

 - Goal 1: improve computational power of the hexapod and integrate with middleware;
 - Goal 2: add machine vision and depth sensing;

### Milestones

 - Milestone 1: add a powerfull embedded computer like [Jetson by NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/jetson-tk1-embedded-dev-kit.html) or [ODROID XU4](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G143452239825) with [Primesense depth camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeSense) and GPS;
 - Milestone 2: integrate with ROS;
 - Milestone 3: implement a localization and path planning methods;
 - Milestone 4: learn which objects can be climbed;
