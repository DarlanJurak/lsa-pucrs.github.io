title: Painter robot for shipbuilding
---

## Project description

Large metal structures such as oil tanks and large ships requires regular mantainance to reduce the effects of corrosion.
Painting is one of the tasks regularly performed to increase the lifespam of these structures.
However, the manual painting process takes a long time. In addition it is unhealthy and unsafe for the worker.

The goal of this project is to design a robot, in cooperation with [Instor](www.instor.com.br) and [UNISC](), and partially funded by [SCIT/RS](www.scit.rs.gov.br).
